            <p>Piotr Migdał, PhD, is a data science freelancer with quantum physics background. His doctoral thesis, from ICFO in Castelldefels (Barcelona), was centered on data visualization and complex networks techniques for quantum states. His current projects are focused on the application of machine learning and interactive visualizations for education (e.g. analysis of the  Polish high school exam) and biology. He is dedicated to gifted children education.</p>

            <h4>Jan P. Radomski</h4>
            <p>(data preparation)</p>
            <p>Jan P. Radomski is currently a staff member in the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling University of Warsaw, Poland. He is the main coordinator of the RIVERS (Resistance of Influenza Viruses in Environmental Reservoirs and Systems) project maintained within the EU Framework Programme. His major research interests are focused on alignment-free genome sequence analysis by the ISSCOR method. It is based on the observation that synonymous codons do not occur at equal frequencies. Codon usage and codon bias have been extensively studied. However, the sequential order in which synonymous codons appear within a gene has not been studied until now. ISSCOR is an in silico method, which is the first attempt to tackle this problem: to what extent this sequential order is unique, and to what extent the succession of synonymous codons is important.

            <p>Dariusz Plewczynski, PhD, is an assistant professor at University of Warsaw, the head of Functional and Structural Laboratory in Center of New Technologies CeNT, Warsaw, Poland. His expertise covers functional and structural genomics with the special focus on higher-order chromatin organization and its impact on gene regulation and transcription. The major computational tools that are used in his interdisciplinary research team include statistical data analysis (GWAS studies, clustering, machine learning), genomic variation analysis using diverse data sources (karyotyping, confocal microscopy, aCGH microarrays, next generation sequencing: both whole genome and whole exome), bioinformatics (protein sequence analysis, protein structure prediction), and finally biophysics (polymer theory and simulations) and genomics (epigenetics, genome domains, three dimensional structure of chromatin).
